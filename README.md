# X-ray-fracture-detection
This deep learning project applies the YOLO object detection algorithm to detect bone fractures in X-ray images. The aim is to support doctors and researchers by providing a fast, accurate, and automated tool for medical imaging.


## 🎯 Project Goals
- Help doctors detect fractures faster and reduce human errors.  
- Reduce the time needed to diagnose medical images (improve diagnostic speed).  
- Facilitate automated analysis of large medical datasets.
